Add the created documents to the doc folder as well. 
Enhance product backlog a bit with respect to adding more detailed stories and description of them. 
Usually Testing is not a heading as a part of the product backlog (It’s usually to-do, in-progress and done) but that’s okay for now. 
Overall, good work!
